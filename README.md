# Advanced Multi Lingual Sentiment Analysis Toolkit

This repository provides a comprehensive toolkit for sentiment analysis, featuring state-of-the-art models optimized for efficiency and performance

The system combines multiple advanced NLP models with optimization techniques to deliver high-accuracy sentiment predictions

### Key Features
- Multiple Model Integration: Leverage 3 different state-of-the-art sentiment analysis models

- Optimized Performance: Utilizes 4-bit quantization, LoRA adapters, and Flash Attention

- Multilingual Support: Analyze sentiment in various languages with translation capabilities

- Efficient Inference: Optimized for both CPU and GPU environments

- Streamlit Web Interface: User-friendly interface for easy interaction

### Limitation

- Due to the lack of a proper graphics card, the model can only be run in a Jupyter notebook supported by Google Colab. 
- Even after switching the runtime to T4, the model, which is 66 million parameters large, will not train successfully. 
- Therefore, you will need to manage with this limitation
